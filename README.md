# Keyboard Acoustic Emanations Attack Research

## Objectives
  * Create a tool with various machine learning models and algorithms to create
    a purely "audio-based" keylogging attack. (referred to as a "keyboard acoustic 
    emanations attack")
  * Ideally requires no supervised training, and instead uses unsupervised methods to
    approximate typed keys according to key-press sound waveform and wave intervals.
